This project took pre-processed data from a client regarding requisition time to fill and candidates per req.

The output is an RShiny dashboard that allows for simple interaction with the information for each req and a breakdown of time to hire per corporate division.

This program requires a CSV file (in this case, titled 'ready.csv') that contains the following columns:

**Requisition ID**
**Requisition Display Job Title**
**Requisition Division**
Requisition Owner - Name
Requisition Date Filled
Applicant Submission Source
**Requisition Time to Fill**
**Candidates per req**
